# Operator Precedence Evaluator

This is a simple program I wrote to accompany a blog post I wrote (still not
published) on how to make a simple stack-based operator precedence parser and
evaluator.

While I have written parses and expression evaluators before, I have never
written an operator precedence parser, and I wanted to see if I could make
a simple one that could be easy to understand.

The code is well commented, but for the theory behind my parser and evaluator,
please see [this blog post](https://ghost.pileborg.se/2016/10/08/simple-stack-based-operator-precedence-parser/).
